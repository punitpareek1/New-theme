Dr. Engelhardt Directs the P30 Center for Gene Therapy of Cystic Fibrosis, now in its 21st year of continuous funding from NIDDK. Dr. Engelhardt is Professor and Chair of the Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology, and Professor in the Department of Internal Medicine at the University of Iowa Carver College of Medicine. He also holds the Roy J. Carver Chair in Molecular Medicine. The majority of his laboratory now focuses on cystic fibrosis research and includes: 1) the study of the molecular and cellular pathogenesis of cystic fibrosis (CF) lung disease and diabetes, 2) the development of novel larger animals models of CF and other lung diseases, and 3) the development of gene therapies for CF and the biology of viral infection. An expanding focus of the Engelhardt laboratory is the creation of new genetic disease models in the domestic ferret, a species that has attractive biologic attributes to study lung disease. His laboratory uses somatic cell nuclear transfer and genome-editing technologies to produced disease models in the ferret. His group is also engaged in clinical trials evaluating the pathogenesis of cystic fibrosis related diabetes in infants and children 3 months to 5 years of age. This clinical trial is evaluating hormonal disturbances that influence insulin secretion and beta-cell function, and relating these changes to detailed studies of the CF ferret model, which also develops diabetes similar to CF patients."}},"d2041404-b9f8-4c0b-993e-af8deef32d7d":{"type":"mission","settings":{"text1":"Philip Cotter, Ph.D.","text2":"Principal and Co-Founder at ResearchDx.
