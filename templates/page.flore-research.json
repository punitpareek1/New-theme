When his son began suffering from GI distress, Sunny went to find a probiotic. Standing in front of the probiotic aisle i.e. the \"Wall of Confusion\", Sunny quickly realized there wasn't a probiotic solution available. This is because his son's gut e.g. microbiome is unique. Instead of choosing a supplement at random, Sunny took tons off the shelf that day and instead of going home, he went to the lab and began testing probiotics, sequencing his son's microbiome, and researching strains that best matched his son's microbiome analysis. This is our story.<\/p>","video":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=xKUhEjI17H0"}}},"order":["16523617557aeb3ad6","1652424959648e8c39","165242496623fc0706","37b2517d-70e1-449d-8466-3e00c4e14266","81bf850d-50a3-4c15-a61f-27ea24a9da04","1652425003daa1d2c2"]}
