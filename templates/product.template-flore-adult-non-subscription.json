While optional, these retests can give you great insight to how your microbiome is changing thanks to the probiotics and\/or lifestyle and diet changes. \nIf you send in the free retest, we will update your formula for your next shipment. If the probiotics are starting to not feel like they are working as well as when you first started, we always recommend using the retest to see what new gut issues may be causing your gut to feel different.","padding_top_bottom":100}},"16661755176a493f48":{"type":"apps","blocks":{"bfa3bf4b-0571-4be8-bd36-9b9849e2c073":{"type":"shopify:\/\/apps\/yotpo-product-photo-reviews\/blocks\/reviews\/eb7dfd7d-db44-4334-bc49-c893b51b36cf","settings":{"product":"{{product}}"}}},"block_order":["bfa3bf4b-0571-4be8-bd36-9b9849e2c073"],"settings":{"section_heading":"Reviews"}},"16563213245cef7012":{"type":"googleResultAdult","blocks":{"f6f1aeab-e94b-421e-9ee8-45973884fac8":{"type":"text","settings":{"detailsImage":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/Vector_Smart_Object_4_d196a762-1ecc-4ce0-ac63-fb4f0a9f4d65.png","detailsText":"81% of Customers Reported Improvement in Immunity"}},"de89e32b-f8b5-42de-a47e-292015cc8d92":{"type":"text","settings":{"detailsImage":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/Vector_Smart_Object_5.png","detailsText":"83% of Customers Reported Increase in Energy"}},"0e357992-4ec6-47f7-9826-723670abf257":{"type":"text","settings":{"detailsImage":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/Vector_Smart_Object_6.png","detailsText":"87% of Customers Reported Relief from Bloating, Gas, SIBO, Leaky Gut, & Other Digestive Issues"}},"809a42a4-138c-4103-95b4-b4cab98cb725":{"type":"text","settings":{"detailsImage":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/Vector_Smart_Object_8.png","detailsText":"80% of Customers Reported Better Food Tolerance"}}},"block_order":["f6f1aeab-e94b-421e-9ee8-45973884fac8","de89e32b-f8b5-42de-a47e-292015cc8d92","0e357992-4ec6-47f7-9826-723670abf257","809a42a4-138c-4103-95b4-b4cab98cb725"],"settings":{"headline":"Real Results from Floré Tots Users","subhead":"After 3 Months on Floré"}},"16563218026e1c0f43":{"type":"explore-other-products","settings":{"headline":"Check Out Our Other Products","subhead":"","style":"h1{}","background_color":""}},"1656321543d5c76904":{"type":"home-new-trustpilot-review","settings":{"heading":"See What Everyone is Saying","poweredby":"<h6 class=\"powered_by\">POWERED BY <img width=\"160\" height=\"40\" src=\"https:\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/0605\/8177\/3565\/files\/Trustpilot_logo.png?v=1646052191\" alt=\"Trustpilot Logo\">\n<\/h6>"}},"1656308782fb8e439d":{"type":"faqs-products","blocks":{"7278a3cc-4c16-4748-be8b-60d7b4c21194":{"type":"block-1","settings":{"subheadline_accordion":"What is the microbiome?","subheadline_data_accordion":"The microbiome is the collection of all the microbes and their corresponding set of genes.
