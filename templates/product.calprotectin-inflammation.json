As a result, this inflammatory event triggers an increase of Calprotectin in your gut. The Calprotectin is then detected in your stool through the Floré Calprotectin Test.","image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/Vector_Smart_Object_14_1.png"}},"a9de3a6e-9e35-4efd-9a05-127e047c4668":{"type":"work","settings":{"heading":"Differentiating Between IBS and IBD","heading_type":"h3","heading_color":"#000000","description":"Intestinal inflammation is associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and with some bacterial gastrointestinal (GI) infections, but it is not associated with many other disorders that affect bowel function and cause similar symptoms.
