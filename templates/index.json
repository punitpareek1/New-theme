When his son began suffering from GI distress, Sunny went to find a probiotic. Standing in front of the probiotic aisle i.e. the \"Wall of Confusion\", Sunny quickly realized there wasn't a probiotic solution available. This is because his son's gut e.g. microflora is unique. Instead of choosing a supplement at random, Sunny took tons of probiotics off the shelf that day and instead of going home, he went to the lab and began testing probiotics, sequencing his son's microflora, and researching strains that best matched his son's microflora analysis. Through testing his son’s gut, he formulated the world’s first custom probiotic for his son’s diet and lifestyle. This is our story.<\/p>\n<h3>Founded on Science<\/h3>\n<p>Sun Genomics aims to change they way we choose a probiotic by making the best custom formulated probiotics. We spent years in research and development perfecting our patented techniques to develop the largest gut microflora interpretation platforms in the world.
