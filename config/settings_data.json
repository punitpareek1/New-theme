When his son began suffering from GI distress, Sunny went to find a probiotic. Standing in front of the probiotic aisle i.e. the \"Wall of Confusion\", Sunny quickly realized there wasn't a probiotic solution available. This is because his son's gut e.g. microflora is unique. Instead of choosing a supplement at random, Sunny took tons of probiotics off the shelf that day and instead of going home, he went to the lab and began testing probiotics, sequencing his son's microflora, and researching strains that best matched his son's microflora analysis. Through testing his son’s gut, he formulated the world’s first custom probiotic for his son’s diet and lifestyle. This is our story.<\/p>\n<h4>Founded on Science<\/h4>\n<p>Sun Genomics aims to change they way we choose a probiotic by making the best custom formulated probiotics.

We create custom formulated probiotics so you can take control of your gut health. We want to empower and educate our customers with the information and knowledge they need to understand what they’re putting in their bodies. It all starts with getting to know your gut. When you take our gut health test, you’ll be able to see exactly what makes up your microbiome down to the strain.<\/p>\n\n<h3>A Comprehensive Stool Test For Your Gut<\/h3>\n\n<p>Once you get your results from our stool test, we’ll start formulating a tailored gut probiotic formulation for you. If you’ve been suffering from any number of gut related issues like IBS, leaky gut, lactose intolerance, or Crohn's disease, universal probiotics might not be the best solution for you. Our custom formulated probiotics can help alleviate bloating, stomach pain, and increase your energy helping you perform at your best.<\/p>\n\n<h3>Our Custom Formulated Probiotics<\/h3>\n\n<p>Above all else, we value quality to make sure you’re putting only the best beneficial ingredients and supplements in your body. When you order our Floré Precision Probiotics, rest assured you’re taking safe products for you and your family. Our probiotics are natural, vegan (upon request), non-GMO, gluten-free, and made without preservatives or fillers. Our custom formulated probiotic includes unique probiotic strains, prebiotics, and natural botanicals that all work together as a positive community to support your microflora. We also ship our probiotics in sustainable packaging and provide you with a reusable bamboo container for your refills.<\/p>\n\n<h3>Microbiome &amp; Microflora<\/h3>\n\n<p>You may have seen the words “microbiome” and “microflora” all over our website but what do those words actually mean? The microbiome is the DNA of all the microflora in your gut. The microflora (sometimes also referred to as microbiota) is all the actual cells of bacteria, fungi, viruses, etc. that live in your gut. Imagine your gut is a garden filled with all of these beneficial vegetables and unfavorable weeds. You want to make sure you’re feeding your good vegetables all the nutrients they need and decreasing the number of weeds in your garden. Custom probiotics provides you with all the soil (natural botanicals like tumeric), seeds (unique probiotic strains), and fertilizer (specialized prebiotic fibers and oligosaccharides) so your garden can flourish. It's a complete solution for gut balance, performance, and restoration.<\/p>\n\n<h3>What to Expect When You Take Probiotics (How Fast Do They Work and Side Effects)<\/h3>\n\n<p>It's no surprise that everyone is different. So, it makes sense that how and when you react to probiotics may be different than others. Some of our subscribers reported noticing a difference within as little as 3 weeks. The most common probiotics side effects are general stomach discomfort for the first few days of taking your custom formulated probiotic. This is why we supply a 7 day “prime” formula that is a low dose way to ease into your probiotic. Not so common probiotics side effects (but totally ok) may be slightly loose stool, fatigue, and occasional headaches. If you have any of these issues when taking a probiotic, remember your probiotic is custom so we can adjust the formula to be just right and comfortable for you.<\/p>\n\n<h3>Signs That Probiotics Are Working<\/h3>\n\n<p>Some of the signs that probiotics are working can depend on what your symptoms were before taking the probiotics. If you suffer from constipation or bloating, your frequency of these symptoms may be relieved. Our customers reported increase in energy, relief from bloating, gas, SIBO, leaky gut, better food tolerance, and other digestive issues. Another way you can actually see if your probiotics are working is to retest your microflora. After your first 3 months of probiotics, you’ll have the option to run the stool test again and then see, in our encrypted web portal, how your microbiome has changed.<\/p>\n\n<h3>A Message from Our Founder<\/h3>\n<p>If you've ever known how it feels to be lost in front of a sea of nutrition labels, you'll know how I felt, stuck in front of my grocery store's probiotics section helplessly struggling to find a remedy for my son's dysbiosis. As a scientist, I didn't want to blindly trust the symptoms that each synthetic bottle claimed to cure, but I didn't know how to begin to choose the right probiotic. Eventually, after trying to decipher the labels in futility, I finally decided that I wouldn't just buy one bottle. I bought as many bottles as I could get my hands on, not to use but to test in the lab.<\/p>\n\n<p>After careful experimentation, I discovered that 85 percent of the probiotics on the shelf didn't even survive our stomach acids. What's more is that any given person only shares 10 percent microbiome similarity with anyone else, so there was no way one product could be made for every unique consumer. I realized then that I had to do something about this to help people like me who were simply looking for effective probiotic supplements. Floré is everything I wish I had that one restless night.<\/p>"}},"scientific-papers":{"type":"scientific-papers","blocks":{"a9861d29-c1d8-47cb-9e00-8d8c2d1e3371":{"type":"order","settings":{"scientific_papers":"Alterations in Gut Microbiome Composition and Function in Irritable Bowel Syndrome and Increased Probiotic Abundance with Daily Supplementation","paragraph":"<p>ASM Journals mSystems Vol. 6, No. 6, 02 November 2021<\/p><p><\/p>","link_text":"View Paper","link_pdf":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1128\/mSystems.01215-21"}},"d90868f6-1660-48b6-9294-d84b151ccc7c":{"type":"order","settings":{"scientific_papers":"The Infant Microbiome Development: Mom Matters","paragraph":"<p>The NIH has concluded that C-section and antibiotic use on infants increases disease burden on children, especially if they are formula fed post birth.

An expanding focus of the Engelhardt laboratory is the creation of new genetic disease models in the domestic ferret, a species that has attractive biologic attributes to study lung disease. His laboratory uses somatic cell nuclear transfer and genome-editing technologies to produced disease models in the ferret. His group is also engaged in clinical trials evaluating the pathogenesis of cystic fibrosis related diabetes in infants and children 3 months to 5 years of age.

Stool, commonly miscalled waste or something to discard, contains the truth of what is happening inside for our bodies. The data that can be collected from stool analysis can give us insights into the state of our health to many of our internal systems. New science has now implicated your stool microbiome and other biomarkers as ways to determine if we have good mental health, sleep, weight loss, chronic conditions, and healthy aging. Next time you go \"number two\", take a look at your stool as compared to the Bristol chart of stool below.<\/p>\n\n<h3>The Bristol Stool Chart Meaning<\/h3>\n\n<p>On the far left of the chart below you will see the numbers 1-7 that ranks your stool. The stool shape chart and descriptions next to these numbers are to help guide you to rank your stool. In general, a ranking of 3-4 is considered normal. When you rank 1-2 you may be experiencing some level of constipation and when you rank 5-7 you may be too low in dietary fiber or experiencing some level of diarrhea. All of these rankings have specific microbiome related associations that may have insights to your overall health. To find out what microbes make up your microbiome, you can read more about getting a comprehensive gut test.<\/p>","image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/bristol-stool-chart-2.jpg","paragraph2":"<h3>The Bristol Stool Chart Color<\/h3>\n<p>\nThis quick test above can quickly give you information on your stool health. One other factor to consider is the color of the stool. The color list below may help guide the reasons for changes in color.<\/p>\n\n<p>Green: Stool is dehydrated, passed through your intestinal tract too quickly, or colored due to consumption of leafy greens or green food coloring.<\/p>\n\n<p>Black: Stool may have some blood coming from the intestinal system and coloring the stool darker than normal.<\/p>\n\n<p>Red: Stool may have blood within it and could be an early sign of an issue. Try to rule out red food coloring from food such as beats.<\/p>\n\n<p>Brown: Stool natural color at varying degrees, generally a healthy sign.<\/p>\n\n<p>Yellow: Stool that may have too many fats or some form of malabsorption of the digestive system.<\/p>\n\n<p>White: Stool may not have come in contact with other biles and salts it normally does in the digestive system.<\/p>\n<br>\n<h3>References<\/h3>\n\n<p>1.

This Research Study is sponsored by and occurs within the facilities of Sun Genomics and its contractors. Most of the study will take place at the Sun Genomics facility located at 10210 Campus Point Dr. Suite 150, San Diego, CA 92121.<\/p>\n\n<p>PROCEDURES You will be asked to provide a stool sample, to be taken at home or on-site. We will assign a unique coded identification number to your consent form and your stool sample; the coded number will be used to identify the stool sample. The consent form will be held by an individual not associated with the conduct of the study; the de-identified stool sample will be delivered to Stella Kramer, or equivalently qualified personnel that shall be designated from time to time, who will provide your sample to Sun Genomics laboratory personnel. The laboratory personnel will perform the DNA extraction process on your sample and attempt to sequence your sample with the extracted DNA. Any results generated from sequencing your sample will be de- identified, so no one will know it is your sample, as explained below. Laboratory personnel may repeat the DNA extraction process and or assay one or more times on any of the stool sample that remains. Sun Genomics will retain your sample for a minimum of 1 year for follow up or confirmation of research results. The expected duration of the project is six months. The de- identified results of the Research Study will be used solely to evaluate the performance of the DNA extraction process, the quality of results obtained with the extracted DNA, and our ability to perform the procedures such as sequencing and microbiome profiling. De-identified information regarding the amount of DNA obtained from a sample may be provided to regulatory agencies in the course of CLIA Laboratory certification. This type of information does not allow the sample to be traced back to you. DNA sequence information will not be provided to a regulatory agency. Other than as stated in this paragraph, the de-identified results of the study will not be provided to anyone outside of Sun Genomics without your authorization. The de-identified results of the Research Study, including any genotyping and\/or sequencing data will not be provided to you. You may receive summary information for the purpose of collecting feedback and improving the product. This Research Study is not intended to treat or diagnose, and is for quality and testing purposes only in order to evaluate a DNA extraction process for use in future, applications and our ability to use the DNA, and metagenomics analysis. Sun Genomics will not perform any monitoring of you during or after the Research Study, but you may be asked to provide follow up samples to examine changes to your microbiome profile over time.<\/p>\n\n<p>CONFIDENTIALITY Your identity in this Research Study will be treated as confidential and we will protect this confidentiality in several ways. Your signed consent form will be maintained by a Sun Genomics team member not associated with the conduct of the Research Study and nobody else within Sun Genomics will have access to such consent form. The identification number assigned to your stool sample and to your consent form will be stored in a secure location. Only one designated person at Sun Genomics will have the link between your name and the identification number that labels your sample. The sex and race associated with your sample may be provided to the laboratory personnel for purposes of analyzing the data generated from your sample, however, this information will not allow the laboratory personnel to trace the sample back to you. If you choose to tell others about your participation in this Research Study, then Sun Genomics will still protect the confidentiality of your sample and its associated identification number. Sun Genomics will not provide or return samples or any extracts, aliquots, or derivatives to you or to any other external individuals.<\/p>\n\n<p>POSSIBLE RISKS AND BENEFITS This Research Study involves very minimal physical risk. The likelihood of harm associated with providing a stool sample is very low and may include slight pain or discomfort, possible risk of contamination exposure, and a minimal risk of infection at the site of stool draw. The risks associated with any inadvertent disclosure of your genetic information, assay information, or sample are also low because Sun Genomics has in place procedures to protect your confidentiality, as described above, and your sample will be securely stored in the Sun Genomics repository for a minimum of 1 year. Except as stated above, you will not receive any results generated from your sample. This non-invasive procedure should have no adverse effects, but we cannot account for any existing conditions that may impact your ability to collect a sample for Sun Genomics. If, after your stool collection, you experience persistent (+2 hours) swelling and inflammation at the site, please contact your health care provider and then Stella Kramer, or equivalently qualified personnel that shall be designated from time to time, at Sun Genomics to record the issue. The study of your sample may, one day, result in a DNA extraction, analysis, or interpretation process that may be used in association with Sun Genomics product and service offerings, which may in turn benefit Sun Genomics, the scientific community and the public health.

When his son began suffering from GI distress, Sunny went to find a probiotic. Standing in front of the probiotic aisle i.e. the \"Wall of Confusion\", Sunny quickly realized there wasn't a probiotic solution available. This is because his son's gut e.g. microflora is unique. Instead of choosing a supplement at random, Sunny took tons of probiotics off the shelf that day and instead of going home, he went to the lab and began testing probiotics, sequencing his son's microflora, and researching strains that best matched his son's microflora analysis. Through testing his son’s gut, he formulated the world’s first custom probiotic for his son’s diet and lifestyle. This is our story.<\/p>\n<h4>Founded on Science<\/h4>\n<p>Sun Genomics aims to change they way we choose a probiotic by making the best custom formulated probiotics. We spent years in research and development perfecting our patented techniques to develop the largest gut microflora interpretation platforms in the world. At Sun Genomics, we believe that before we can advance the market, we must first advance the science.<\/p>","video":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=xKUhEjI17H0","video_2":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=ECHo_lm57as"}},"static-newsletter-new":{"type":"static-newsletter-new","settings":{"enable":true}},"header":{"type":"header","blocks":{"f82c30ce-d2ba-4889-8627-c4e5d0df4cdb":{"type":"text","settings":{"member-portal":"My Portal Account","member-portal-url":"https:\/\/portal.flore.com\/","subheading":"Review Test Results","show_link":false,"other_tab":true}},"0d8b95f0-6816-42ac-b5f5-0f45a9d2a392":{"type":"text","settings":{"member-portal":"My Billing Account","member-portal-url":"","subheading":"Manage Subscriptions","show_link":true,"other_tab":false}},"0594fb8f-75cf-4b33-b30a-154dccd406a6":{"type":"text","settings":{"member-portal":"My Rewards","member-portal-url":"shopify:\/\/pages\/flore-rewards","subheading":"Manage Points & Refer Friends","show_link":false,"other_tab":false}}},"block_order":["f82c30ce-d2ba-4889-8627-c4e5d0df4cdb","0d8b95f0-6816-42ac-b5f5-0f45a9d2a392","0594fb8f-75cf-4b33-b30a-154dccd406a6"],"settings":{"header_logo":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/Flore_by_SG_Updated_Logo_1_fde9722e-5dac-479a-90d5-96af7474ad83.svg","menu":"menu-account","phone":"661-888-4799","account-management":"My Account","account-management-url":"https:\/\/flore.com\/account","Register_a_kit":"Register A Kit","Register_a_kit-url":"https:\/\/portal.flore.com\/","show_cart":true,"show_search":true,"enable_predictive_search":true}},"footer":{"type":"footer","blocks":{"c9ffba33-5105-45bb-9d38-ef924bf227e1":{"type":"term-menu","settings":{"menu-text":"Refund Policy","menu-link":"shopify:\/\/pages\/refund-policy"}},"8579c4bd-ddba-45c8-aed7-64e69ba5d8de":{"type":"term-menu","settings":{"menu-text":"Terms and Conditions","menu-link":"shopify:\/\/pages\/terms-and-conditions"}},"6ce55e35-f6a6-4901-b774-a7ed71c48d70":{"type":"term-menu","settings":{"menu-text":"Privacy Policy","menu-link":"shopify:\/\/pages\/privacy-policy"}}},"block_order":["c9ffba33-5105-45bb-9d38-ef924bf227e1","8579c4bd-ddba-45c8-aed7-64e69ba5d8de","6ce55e35-f6a6-4901-b774-a7ed71c48d70"],"settings":{"footer_logo":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/flore-new-logo.png","menu-product":"footer-products","menu-learn":"footer-learn","menu-about":"footer-about","play_store_icon":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/playstore.png","play_store_link":"https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/apps\/details?id=com.sungenomics","app_store_icon":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/Download_on_the_App_Store_Badge_US-UK_RGB_blk_092917-svg_1.jpg","app_store_link":"https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/app\/flor%C3%A9\/id1479149471","footer-form-title":"Stay in the know!","footer-form-text":"Helpful tips, recommendations and news delivered right to your inbox.","copyright":"Sun Genomics is not affiliated with Sun Pharma or Sun Pharmaceuticals Industries Ltd.","term_line":"*for illustrative purposes only.
